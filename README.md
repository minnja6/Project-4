TechDegree Project 4
Game Show OOP--this game is similar to hangman, you will need to guess the letters that are in each phrase, if the correct letter is chosen it will appear on the screen included in the phrase, if the wrong letter is chosen it will disable that chosen letter on the screen and computer key board and you will lose 1 out of 5 lives displayed as hearts on the botton of the screen. 
The laptop or computer keyboard will also work for choosing letters while guessing the phrase.
I am aiming for exceeds expectations
I changed the color of the win and lose background as well as the color of the start up screen and size of the button.
I also changed the color of the buttons, pink for the correctly chosen letter and black for the wrong chosen answer.
